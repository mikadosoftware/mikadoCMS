Google Webmaster tools
======================

Ok, I have a `website <http://www.mikadosoftware.com>`_ - no what?

* Get google to notice
* Get google analytics

Google TO notice
================



Right google webmasters is, well tools to make it easier to play by Googles
rules.  THe most obvious one is to (login) and then prove that you own and
control that domain.

So, visit https://www.google.com/webmasters and login, then ``add`` a site to
the list.  My preferred method is to have to put a UUID into the HEAD of my
index file.  I usually find that simplest. (The default google approach is put a
seperate html file in, which is a workaround I need for my rst2html process so I
ignore it.)


Google Analytics
================

Need to add some javascript snippets


We login to google.com/analytics
We click Admin, we clikc tracking code.
And we grab the snippet.
