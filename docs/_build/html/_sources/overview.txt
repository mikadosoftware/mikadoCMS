What I am looking for

1. My own CMS that can cope with low level demands (1-10K req / day).
2. An ability to store mikado documents securely in the cloud / site 
   (I am assuming everything is for remote distributed workers, so
    redthedocs privately, a dashboard for the company (private)
   )

3. CMS
   v.0.1 ::
   
         Runs on gunicorn behind nginx
         Deploys from fabfile via bamboo?
         serves templated file depending on given path
         RUns on three domains       

   v 0.2 analytics
         Google analytics
         funnels?
