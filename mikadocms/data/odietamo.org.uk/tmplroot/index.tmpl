<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/data-integrator/overview/index.html">Oracle Data Integrator (ODI)</a> is a vital tool in many Enterprises' Big Data Strategy. Its code moves data from siloed business stores to massive warehouses.
<p>
However as more data warehouse teams become Agile, they hit a roadblock - the source code for those routines moving data around are hidden from normal source control practises, locked away in database tables, not in Subversion or git.
<p>
ODI-SCM is an Open Source project that gets the source code for your ODI routines out of the repos, and into your source control.  There you can branch, merge, and control your code, across multiple development teams, and never miss a commit.
<p>
Solve the chaos of multiple teams deleting each others work.  Use ODI-SCM.
