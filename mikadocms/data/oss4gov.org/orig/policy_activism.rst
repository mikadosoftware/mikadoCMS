Policy Activism

Less dangerous than it sounds, I believe that local councils will take seriously their local developer communities, if those communities sensibly and with respect promote Open Source development as a viable, indeed, better alternative, and promote OSS as a `preferred <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/choosing-technology>`_ choice - just as gov.uk recommends !

I am doing this with my local council, (you know, the one on the same rainy road) and will keep you posted.

If you are interested in talking to your local councillors about this, join the newsletter above, and let me know.  I will put up some more useful material.
