Open Source For Government
==========================

We believe that Open Source Software is much more than merely "free of charge".

It is the only right and proper means for publically funded bodies to 
purchase and develop software.  The source code for a public service *is* a 
public good.  And it should be freely available to all.

There are over 2000 services that UK public bodies are funded in order to provide.

Each of those 2000 services will soon be delivered, in part or wholly, through digital 
means, and thus be entirely dependant on software.

OSS4Gov.org intends to kickstart the development of Open Source Software for 
those services, and will bring its campaign to a close when every service in
the LGSL list has a working Open solution available.
