User Need
=========

``User Need`` is a central concept for the new breed of Open Source advocates in
UK government.  It is generally accepted as a focus on the needs of the *citizen* end-user.  However I also think that as we move from large government projects that cover the front entranceway of government we will move into smaller, lower-transaction services - where *at any one time* there is rarely an order of magnitude more citizens than government employees engaged in a transaction.  For example the number of shops applying for a change in use is hardly larger than the number of Planning Officers.

So there soon become two sets of users.  The citizen *and* the government employee. And if we want to deliver good service to the citizen, its probably a better investment of time to deliver usable software to the government than move a citizens software from 80% to 98%
