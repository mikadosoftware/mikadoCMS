Pilot Projects
==============

The immediate goal of the campaign is to move 4 ideas to actual pilot projects.
These pilots will obviously be used to judge how effective the OSS in government
approach is, as well as actually delivering value.

A brief run-down of what a project will involve is below


Pure Play
---------

A government pure play is a service that *only governments do*.  There is a lot
of action in the OSS world around delivering CMS solutions into government.
This is a Good Thing.  But it is really just providing an electronic replacement
to the lobby of the Town Hall.  The nitty gritty work in the back still needs
attacking.  And that nitty-gritty, unlike CMSes, is not something that
commercial companies also need.  Everyone uses CMSes, so there are a lot to choose from.  Not so 

A *pure-play* service is something like Electoral Roll Management or Licensing
retail businesses.  It's going to be low-transaction, niche work. Unglamorous,
slogging, and really important to the people who will use it - at both ends of
the transaction.

The `LGSL </lgsl>`_ is a good place to start.  It lists 2100 services local
governments provide, from the mundane to the life-saving. 

From here we shall find services that are currently 

* poorly served (if at all) by their current IT 
* have council champions that want them to succeed

  

Identify the right people
-------------------------

We want to find not only the top sponsors, like council leaders and CEOs,
but we also want the people who know what's going on (!)

We need to find, *and get a commitment of their time from the council leaders*
the people who are *domain experts* in the service we are looking at.


Grit sprint
-----------

Just as a piece of grit works into an oyster, we want to create a Minimum VIable Grit.  During a sprint, attended by Open Source developers *and* the domain expert whose time has been assured by the council for the pilot project, we shall produce the first cut of what will become a pearl.

Something just valueable enough for the domain expert to use.



Oyster farming
--------------

At this point we can put the service onto G-Cloud as a SaaS service - and 
then there is a council committed to a project, a domain expert with a piece of just useful software, a set of developers who are able to take the project further, and now, in G-Cloud, a means to make the tender process work *for* us.

We can now take the project forward on a supported, commerical basis, producing Open software that can benefit all 430 councils and bodies.
