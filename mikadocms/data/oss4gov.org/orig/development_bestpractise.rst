Best Practises in Open Source Software Development
==================================================

Software that we get going with the campaign should be good software.

In the end the quality of the code is what matters - long, hard experience
has taught us that comes first.  But there are two areas where good practises help and where we need to teach, encourage and promote - *developer support* and *shared architectural standards*

Developer support is all the good stuff we know we should do - automated regression testing, automated build and deployments, community tools like email and mailing lists, as well as the more personal forms of developer support like organising meetups, sprints and simply reminding us that there is sunshine outside.

Shared architectural standards are a major issue that really will emerge more than be imposed, but I am thinking of efforts like the Cabinet Office's `IdA <http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/category/id-assurance/>`_ programme, or shared service buses and common interfaces to backend software like the common back office (and proprietary) system `uniform`.  There are technical, *architectural* functions almost all systems will expect to exist.  How we deal with that is up to us, but we should go forewarned.


I wish to emphasise that none of this is new or clever, and none of this is to be mandated as the official or only way to develop OSS software. But we have a duty to deliver our best - and there are common ways to get there.
