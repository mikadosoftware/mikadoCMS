Manifesto
=========


Software, paid for by the taxpayer, should be open and free 
   to those taxpayers.  This self-same principle applies to data such as maps,
   and code and data walk hand-in-glove.


Where government directly pays for development of new source code, 
   and also where government is to all intents and purposes the only market
   (think of the market for Electoral Roll Computer Systems) then payment for
   the software should be dependant on the release, under suitable open
   licenses, of that software.



Software sold in massive private markets finds profits capped 
   by competition.  In *government-only software markets*, such price mechanisms
   are rarely effective, and so the license fees paid cannot be confidently
   agreed to be of value to the taxpayer.


By requiring government-only software to be free of license cost, 
   value to the taxpayer will focus on development effort and the price of
   quality.  By requiring the software to be open co-operation between
   authorities is not a matter of complex high level policy and management but a
   matter of frontline dev/ops just getting on with it.


To these ends we want to persuade authorities and councils to place in their
   individual IT and Procurement policies, a preference for Open Source Software
   throughout, and a *requirement* for Open Source Software where taxpayer
   money provides the vast majority of revenue for such software.


We also shall use the campaign to demonstrate, through pilot projects and
   successful commercial ventures, that Open Source Software can be developed
   and deployed more quickly, be of higher quality, meet users needs more
   effectively and most of all deliver more of the Public Good then closed,
   proprietary software in the field of local government.
