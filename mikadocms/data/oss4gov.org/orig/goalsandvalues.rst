Goals and Values
================

I am aiming to make the Open Source Model of development the *norm* for local government software.

I am aiming to promote and actively demonstrate that Open Source code and development approaches 
more closely fit the democratic and transparent ethos of local government than closed, and especially uncompetitive 
models that can be found.

I am aiming to show that software is not for making billions in IPOs, but for making the basic daily life of a society run better.
It counts folks.


Why?
----

Possibly because I am crazy and don't have enough other things to do.
