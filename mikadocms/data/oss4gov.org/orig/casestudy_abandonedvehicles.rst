Abandoned Vehicles - Case Study
===============================

I have taken to using the phrase "everything from Abandoned vehicles to Zoo
licensing" as a short hand for the 2,000+ services councils are expected to
offer (A to Z - geddit?).

And right under my nose the good folks of West Kent are working together to
develop an Abandonded vehicle register / service that ties in multi-agency work,
different CMSes.  It promises plenty of lessons to learn for the campaign.

Please check back here for a case study (coming soon!) on the ups and downs of
the project.
