<p>Two years ago I was driving 100 miles a day around London's M25, living the
typical consultant life.  It was however no way to raise a family and a dumb way
to run a company. 

<p>You see globalisation is not just companies seeking the cheapest workers -
people can also seek out the best companies globally.  The boot is now on the
other foot.

<p>I made two promises - I will not go back to the M25.  And I will not make
anyone working for me sacrifice their family for a career.

<p>Mikado Software is a serious software company, and it is also a trail
breaking scout for a new generation of companies. We will soon be working for
truly global companies who will pull in the very best talent from anywhere,
still all only a 20 minute walk from our loved ones.

<p>Mikado Software will help you put your business in the best shape for the new
global future - because we are already living there.  Come join us.

<p>My name is Paul Brian, and I am an Open Source Developer, father, husband and
entrepreneur.
