We shall be launching JoinMeForCoffee.com soon, as a online meeting place for
just grabbing a coffee, and chatting.  Its like a webinar or a Meetme but with no mucking about with downloads or browser plugins.

So, you decide to meet a business partner for a coffee.  You grab a Latte (and maybe send them the cost of a latte on your starbucks account - more on that later) and then sit at your desk.

Click the join button, set up your name, and send the other person the join 
code.  All they have to do is click on it and you can 

* both see the other persons mouse, 
* both see the page the other person is on
* both chat / IM
* both talk over audio and video (on supported browsers / equipment)

All with just one click.
