Future Trends

Why is the Internet getting all upset.

Because they can see the chaos of the future, close up.  And the best way to 
navigate an uncertain world is to make each decision in the light of common, decent guiding principles.  The recent willingness for American administrations to
discard or wriggle out of those principles when it suited them is not an illustration of the mendacity of politicians (!) but of the failure of the institutions explictly set up to provide checks and balances to actually check and balance.

We are losing our ability to keep to our principles, at the moment it matters most.  This is not good.








Notes - My reference chasing has not been exhastive and the hidden agenda's of
some of these references are opaque to me - this is most obvious in non-peer
reviewed work regarding military and welfare spending.  If this is of interest
or you have peer reviewed work conflicting the belwo do please write your own
blog post and mail me a link.  I would be interested in reading :-)

Laser Guns !

A very rough overview of the situation:

 * chemical lasers
   Heavy hitters - can deliver 1MW (!) of beam.  But use "six shipping contianers spread over 10,000 sq ft".  So not very portable.

 * SSL comnbined lasers (This is the Northrupp Grumman) 
   By combining laser beam output in a "coherent" manner you can join 
   5 x 5KW lasers into one 25KW beam.  The promise is that this is linearly
   scalable

The combined SSL apporach is currently the front runner for real work.  
And everyone very nicely talks about how great it will be to put these 
on US ships and around US bases to defend from those nasty evil terrorist types.

But thats not what will change the game.  An SSL of 50KW can shoot down UAVs and small aircraft at short ranges.  An SSL of 50KW is feasible.  And "mobile" with some definition of mobile.

The thing is, US military supieriority is based on three weak points - massed staging areas in friendly countries, air power and moving air power around.

At some point in the next ten years lasers will be able to shoot aircraft and cruise missles out of the air, from ranges of dozens to hundreds of miles.

When you have no air power, what does the world look like?


NHS - worth it or not?

Can I compare these reference costs to effective rated hospitals ?
