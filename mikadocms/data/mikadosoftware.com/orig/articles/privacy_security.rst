Privacy in a digital age
========================

The recent revelations by a NSA employee about the very extensive communications
tapping of by the NSA have triggered a storm of outrage across the Internet, and
an extensive re-evaluation of digital communications by many.

This is my, very personal, view on privacy, and how to keep secure in the new
world.


* How to be private
* How to be secret
* How to stand a chance of privacy online
* metadata and communications privacy



Secrecy vs privacy
------------------

.. epigraph::
   
   Privacy is the politeness of our neighbours.

My private life offline is generally well-known.  My wife has occassionally
commented she knows how often I visit the coffee-house as her friends see me in
there and then bump into her.  I presume if I were to kiss a beautiful blonde in
the coffee-house, my wife would also get to hear about it.  If I wanted to kiss said blonde without my wife finding out I would need to be *secretive* about it - travel to a new town, meet in hotel rooms etc. (I think I will need to re-watch the Walter Mattheu film on this before really trying).  However I would still be relying on the politeness of the hotel clerk not to mention it to my wife.  Or more accurately not to mention it to his friend, who is a friend of a friend ...

Online, this friend of a friend network is very potent.  

Metadata, content, secrecy and privacy.


            

Making connections
------------------

This is an online action and only will get more so.  LinkedIn, Twitter. These
are where "everyone" can be found.  Twitter has meant I have been able to get in touch with people whom 

At some point these "desirable" people will find the onslaught unbearable, 
LinkedIn tries to maintain the current offline networks, and replicate them online.

However *finding* another person is the fundamental use for digital networks - and it is one offline methods simply pale in comparison with.  So if you want to maintain a career, a social life, you will need to particiapte digitally.

Communicating
-------------

Now this is the issues



Framework for politeness
------------------------


Summary
-------

If you want to keep a secret, don't tell anyone.  And stay offline.

I think that spying is going to become really really hard, but oddly I suspect it will be something Vernon Kell would recognise from 1909.  No digital, no phones. Just hard work.

Future for Spy agencies

This is where the activities of state surveillance fit for me - monitoring those emails :-)


Privacy is dead.  Wait till they notice the corpse

Privacy looks a lot like Secrecy
--------------------------------

One of my favourite political quotes was from one of my favourite politicians.
Ex-London Mayor "Red" Ken Livingstone is supposed to have said, when asked why
he had not told the press about his unusual private life [#]_ he said something
like "I kept it private, not secret. Just because I do not tell journalists,
does not mean I am hiding something"

This is an interesting division between two concepts that are rapidly diverging.

My privacy is what I do "behind closed doors".  However, anyone passing my house
can probably hear whats going on, and generally work out from clues left by my
daily life just what does go on behind those doors (err, not a lot sadly).

Now however, the digital footprint of my daily life can be heard and analysed not merely by my neighbours, but by anyone on the Internet who cares to listen.

This is generally seen as a problem.


It is. 


But its not going away.

   with several children seemingly well-adjusted.  Unusual not illegal or
   damaging. Also he got married in London Zoo which despite me begging my
   rather stunned fiance on a trip round the facilities, did not happen.  Truly,
   a cool place to marry.
