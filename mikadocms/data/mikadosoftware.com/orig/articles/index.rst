Blog
====

I blog `here <http://blog.mikadsoftware.com>`_.  Mostly the posts are short,
ideas that have come to me.  Thats because I do longer essays and articles here.

The most interesting include:

* `A small startup <http://blog.mikadosoftware.com/2013/08/01/a-small-startup-the-journey/>`_
* `Software as Capital <http://blog.mikadosoftware.com/2013/08/06/software-capital/>`_  (Which I expand on elsewhere).

Articles
========

Well, this is the meat of what I am trying here.
I care about lots of things but *mostly* I care about my family, 
about the future, and being serious about simple software. 

* `The Big Break <the_break>`_
* `slow code movement <slowcodemovement>`_
* `basic SEO for Independent Workers <basic_seo>`_




Interviews
==========

Talking with interesting people is fun.

* `Patrick MacAndrew - PeerJ <interview_patrickmacandrew>`_
