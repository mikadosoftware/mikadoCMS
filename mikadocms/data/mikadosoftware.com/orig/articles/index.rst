Blog
====

I blog `here <http://blog.mikadsoftware.com>`_.  Mostly the posts are short,
ideas that have come to me.  Thats because I do longer essays and articles here.


Articles
========

Well, this is the meat of what I am trying here.
I care about lots of things but *mostly* I care about my family, 
about the future, and being serious about simple software.
