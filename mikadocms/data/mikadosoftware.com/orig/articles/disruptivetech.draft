So I am talking future company - which means we want to stay relevant, 
even if that means cannibalising our own revenue streams

But what is out there - and how will it productise.

So - look out 5 years, and look out 50 years.  We should get a feel for changes that are coming.


* 2 billion Android devices, plus Firefox OS
  I have no idea.  Its gonna be huge. Dont ask me to explain it.
  I am white, middle class and dont leave the country very often.
  If it makes the world richer and less likely to go to war. I am all for it.

  Actually I do know what it means.
  The Internet and the web are about human rights and individual dignity and freedom.
  About opennness and transparency - not walled gardens and 104 choices of privacy settings.

  There is a reasonable chance that within 5 years *everyone* on the planet
  will have got on line.  Maybe just used the device from the guy in the next village
  or used our grandsons to see the weather tomorrow.
  
  But at some point, the new central nervous system of humanity will touch 
  the last unconnected person.

  The internet as we know it now has been a western middle class driven thing.
  It has kept to its idealistic roots through some serious upheavals, 

  There is an encvumbance on us, the privileged first few, to protect the freedoms
  that have helped us expand and propser, to protect them for the next 5 billion 
  people.  

  Perhaps we should stop calling it Open Source and go back to Free Software.

  It will not get you laid as a look. SOrry.

  We have a wearable piece of computing - its called phone.
  It does everything except take photos of what I am seeing.

  I can imagine glasses for use when alone - a fold out keyboard and 




Contact management - I want my diary and contacts to be better sorted out.

50 years. Well, 90.
The year 2100 will be an interesting one.  
My son will be 91 years old, my daughter 90.  They will be I hope in reasonable health for their age
and I wish them well on their retirement homes. On Mars.

Ok maybe not. but the speed of change seems unlikely to slow down, and we have billions of peopple
to come up with the next good thing.
