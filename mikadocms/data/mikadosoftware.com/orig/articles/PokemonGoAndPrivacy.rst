Pokemon Go and Digital Privacy
------------------------------

So this article is basically a longer reply to my wife's text - "Paul, what's all this about Pokemon Go? Should we let the kids have it?"

The kids in this case are 7 and 5 and have dipped in and out of Pokemon phases - watching the TV shows on Netflix, playing a handheld game, and pretending to be Charmander while running around gardens and parks.  The basic idea behind Pokemon the Tv series and the game were similar. Ash was the hero, an 11ish old boy who wanted to become a Pokemon trainer in Japan.  He lives in a world where small monsters with "powers" are real and living wild.  The trainers capture them from the wild, train them to build up their powers and then ash's Pokemon engage in fights with other trainers Pokemon, leading to winning a tournament and glory. Of course in the TV series many lessons about friendship and honour are learnt, and no one is really hurt.

All in all, I am relaxed about them playing Pokemon to date.  A bit too much TV perhaps and not enough running around but it's a simple theme with a generally positive message and has stood the test of time. 

So what's new? 

Privacy and the digital age

The rise of the digital age, which went into turbo boost around 2008 with widespread availability of three things - smartphones, "cloud" and ???
It's safe to say we are in a new era.  But let's start with what is good or even great about this new age.  We will have near constant, highly detailed tracking of our actions, in the real and virtual worlds.  It is possible to track my physical location, movement, track what I ate and where I was when breathing in.  Add this to my genetic code, my health records and then do it for every person in the country, in the western world.

Epidemiology is a fanataatci branch of science.  It basically tries to look for clever little oddities in human behaviour to work out some medical facts.  For example during WWII rationing meant that every person in the UK was given 

Now imagine how much more we can know about health if we add in all of that tracking data above to these clever methods of discerning 

What happens if middle aged men who don't do much exercise start walking longer. W

What about planning our infrastructure - if we have detailed data on which platforms people take at kings cross we can decide where to build a bridge or make barriers one way.  For cars and pavements and then shopping habits and ... Everything really.

We will come back to this later - but start off with the idea that tracking our daily lives *can* lead to really good benefits for everyone - if we use the data wisely


Pokemon Go
----------

So back to the Pokemon.  Smartphone are almost everywhere. 4.5bn figures
In a coupe of years enough for everyone on the planet will have been sold - most in the "western" world but many many countries are experiencing a new phenonomon - 

Pokemon Go is what is known as an augmented reality app.  You have heard of virtual reality where you put on a clunky looking headset and your eyes see a totally computer generated world.  This is where you look through the screen of your phone and see the real world via the camera, but the app overlays some extra information on top of the image. In a museum it might overlay some notes about the painter.  In Pokemon go it overlays a moving cartoon of a Pokemon. 

This if you as a child want to catch a wild Pokemon, you no longer sit on your sofa computer controller in hand. You go out into the fresh air and walk around.  The app shows you a map, and you walk to the field, the park, the street corner, and look through the screen - and there is a Pokemon monster hiding behind the lamppost, waiting to be caught by swiping the right part of the screen.

Then you need to take it back to your training camp - oh yes that needs to be visited and defended regularly and 

It's going to be awesome
