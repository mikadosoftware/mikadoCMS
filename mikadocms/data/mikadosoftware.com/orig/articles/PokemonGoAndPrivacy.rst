Pokemon Go and Digital Privacy
------------------------------

I never meant to write this article, but I also never meant to wander around London in a three-piece suit chasing invisible monsters.
The two however are very closely tied up.

How I came to write this article is simple - I started to reply to my wife's text, and just kept on typing.  My wife pinged me yesterday with a quick qeustion  "Paul, what's all this about Pokemon Go? Should we let the kids have it?"

The kids in this case are 7 and 5 and have dipped in and out of Pokemon phases - watching the TV show on Netflix, playing a handheld game, and pretending to be Charmander while running around gardens and parks.  It seemed, and let's face it, *is* harmless.

Pokemon is a "media franchise" from Nintendo, and is fairly simple at its heart - an 11ish year old boy who lives in a world where small monsters with "powers" are real and living wild.  The trainers capture them from the wild, train them to build up their powers and then Pokemon engage in fights with other trainers Pokemon, leading to winning a tournament and glory, points, prizes and school playground bragging rights. Of course in the TV series many lessons about friendship and honour are learnt, and no one is really hurt.

All in all, I am relaxed about them playing Pokemon to date.  A bit too much TV perhaps and not enough running around but it's a simple theme with a generally positive message and has stood the test of time. 

Well, it had been ok. Then smartphones.

Smartphones are great.

I am net-positive about the digital age we have been living in (and for me working in) since the early '90s.  And it has accelerated since 2007 when the first iPhone and the first "cloud services" gave the internet a "Fast and Furious" style dose of nitrous oxide.

There are some amazingly great things going to come out of this digital age. `Government services <https://gds.blog.gov.uk/>`_ are going to leap forward a generation as they move to digital, we will join hands across national boundaries in ways that customs officials will panic over, but mostly we will benefit from near-continuous monitoring.

The smartphone was the harbinger of near constant, highly detailed tracking of our actions, in the real and virtual worlds.  It is possible to track my physical location, track what I ate, what the air was like as I breathed there.  Add this to my genetic code, my health records and then do it for every person in the country, in the whole (western) world.

`Epidemiology https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology>`_ is a fantastic branch of science.  It studies the mass of people to look for medical and public health improvements.  The most famous one was a cholera outbreak in Mid-Victorian London. A doctor mapped all the cases he was treating, and saw they grouped around one place - a public water tap.  He removed the handle and the outbreak stopped, proving cholera was water based, and that mapping people in their day to day lives can really help.

Nowadays the doctor can use people's iPhone data to discover which well they drank from.  Or will people with my lifestyle suffer from what disease.

We will come back to this later - but start off with the idea that tracking our daily lives *can* lead to really good benefits for everyone - if we use the data wisely.

Pokemon Go
----------

Pokemon Go is what is known as an augmented reality app.  You have heard of virtual reality where you put on a clunky looking headset and your eyes see a totally computer generated world.  Augmented Reality (AR) is where you look through the screen of your phone and see the real world via the camera, but the app overlays some extra information on top of the image. In a museum it might overlay some notes about the painter.  In Pokemon go it overlays a moving cartoon of a Pokemon. 

Now, if you as a child want to catch a wild Pokemon, you no longer sit on your sofa computer controller in hand. You go out into the fresh air and walk around. (Good!). The app shows you a map, and you walk to the field, the park, the street corner, and look through the screen - and there is a Pokemon monster hiding behind the lamppost, waiting to be caught by swiping the right part of the screen. 

I have played for a very short time, and almost every 10th person walking down the street in London's Financial District was doing the same.  Adults. Slightly shame-faced adults actually.  But Adults.  This game is going to get *big*.

Already we are seeing people taking advantage

Dark side of tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In May 2013, Edward Snowden, an ex-CIA Computer professional stole thousands of top level documents that showed how the governments of the US, UK and elsewhere were systematically gathering, well, pretty much 

Can your child be tracked?

This is the million dollar question. And the answer is, yes, of course, they already are, by everyone.

I hate unfettered internet experience.  All those tracking ads.

How to keep
Safe

- aware of digital footprint (see google watcher etc) 
- aware of your threats 
- write your MP
- am writing book on this - sign up to email newsletter 

Game mechanics and 

The app does not cache (keep a copy after the first download) of the photos of the waypoints. This would easily reduce netowrk load and improve performance
THe future - mesh networks and PVP.
Mesh networks are more private, harder to run surveillance on - they are our future.  THey also are awesome for kids to share pokemon battles on. And so on balance, Pokemnon may save the world from dictators and advertisers.  Go pikachu.
