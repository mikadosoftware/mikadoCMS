Basic SEO for the independent worker
====================================

I believe software is a new form of capital, and it itself takes three forms.
The simplest form is *discover-ability* - for the moment that is essentially
limited to organic search.

So we want to keep adding little pebbles to our pile of discoverability, to
ensure it can support us as independent workers.

Initial Steps
-------------

Own your own domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to any decent DNS provider, I use www.easily.co.uk, they are *fine*, but there are better more techie ones out there.  

Buy a simple .com domain if you can. 
Do not have sub-domain and root-domain both responding with pages.  So example.com should redirect to www.example.com.  Do not CNAME exmaple.com to www.example.com because your email will stop working (mx records are then CNAME'd)!




Host your site on your domain.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The very simplest way to do this is to pay for a domain at wordpress.com.
Its simple, it works, and it can be done in minutes.

Write interesting stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interesting is the wrong word.  Write `remarkable` things, that people will 
point at, link to, refer to.  Be truthful, honest, be yourself.


Choose a theme or an offering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is pretty easy if you are building a `low-maintenance income site`.
My own experiment in this area is www.displaymyresume.com which takes your LinkedIn profile and turns it into a CV.  It's not live yet (!) but it is focused - resume, linkedin, simple, online.

I can write simple articles on making the most of a cover letter, things like that.

But a theme or offering for *me*? For my life ?

That's hard.  As in `business-as-therapy </articles/business-as-therapy>`_ hard.
