Ok, I am not the greatest Open Source developer on the planet. My commit messages often leave a lot to be desired, and snatching a few tens of minutes between job, kids, commutes and life for coding something is never the best way, but I do have a dream.  

I even write about it (http://www.mikadosoftware.com/articles/govuk_contracting) to spend time doing what I love (creating code) and in so doing building something that makes a public good - government services that are open.

I think the right way to do this is not to try and get employed by GDS (which is a nice thing sure, but they cannot write all the code for all the services government needs).  What is going to have to happen is departments and authorities have to prime the pump, pay someone to make a kernel of a service and grow it into an open, maintained piece of real software, with community and support.

So I rather enthusiastically at first and now just so-so, I try and apply for government software contracts that look likely to be real candidates for open software.

And then we get this - a "coroner management system". A replacement for a current *IRIS* database - Noah used one of those to count the animals.

  Open Source software should be avoided as far as possible but, if used, your tender will be evaluated...
  
Really I despair.

No matter the efforts centrally put in, the real consumers and drivers of the billions of pounds in software are outside of GDS' reach - and this is the attitude.

I think the pump needs a lot of priming - and I think the best way now is to go find a couple of right wing dribbling billionaires from Texas and tell them that the governments of the world are slowly going to be adopting open software for their services  - and the last great act of American empire will be to write the code that governments across the world will use day in and day out. No sneaky elliptic curve adjustments but just those baked in western assumptions - combined girls and boys registers for schools to use each morning, that sort of thing.

If I can't persuade 450 different authorities to give me seed money, it's going to have to be monomaniacal right wing idealogues !
