The insane optimist
===================

I generally prefer to comment on longer term political trends - but Donald Trumps election today
is, as the whole campaign has been, an exception.

On HN today a commentator asked about leaving the US, presumably to "escape" Trump.

There is of course an element of post-hoc rationalisation as we come to accept that The Donald will be The Prez.  Which is why as a life-long optimist, I suspect I am being only slightly insane in saying this may just work.

Firstly Donald is, in his bones and his building methods, a "borrow and spend" guy. And with both chambers now Republican, with an electorate that voted on jobs, with Trumps acceptance speech itself talking of building infrastructure and creating millions of jobs doing so, it is a safe bet to say Keynesianism is back on Americas agenda.  Obama consistently had Jobs programs denied him by Congress, a trick they will find almost impossible to play with a white Republican. 

In the U.K. We have just started to suffer from Brexit, but the fiscal response is starting to turn to building our way out.  As ever, the US may be about to show the way.

The States of the US are flexing their independence and muscle more and more - from marijuana to solar power and gay marriage, the culture of the US is changing - as any living thing should - and changing from the ground up.  Europe is only seeing the federalist side of a Union - and we are hating it as much as most Americans Inknownhate their federal government.  Even as they acknowledge the benefits.

The thread Donald Trump seems to have won on is "stop this chaotic and damaging change caused by the Washington elites".  It's much harder to blame those far off elites when it's your State doing the changing.

And States do not only protect cultural identity - As U.K. citizens we have just given up any hope of joining such a federal system - and much to our loss I think. What perhaps we are belated realising is that sovereignty and federalism can be mixed together.  The US have not done it perfectly - Southern ex-slave States still bear the scars of failure to deal with regional imbalances under a single currency, just as Greece is in Europe.  But the economic opportunity is great in both areas.

And my last reason for being optimistic is a simple one. Putin is known for seeing international diplomacy as a brutal, dog-eat-dog world.  And sadly   the world has not proven him wrong. Weakening NATO, putting "American interests first", will not bring about international peace and harmony.  But these are things that the world has dealt with for thousands of years.  We may see war (I'm not that insane) but we have been seeing it anyway under all presidents and Prime Ministers.

Economically we may see massive productive Keynesian spending, culturally we will see change continuing - far right voices will be more emboldened but they are not the only voice. And diplomats still exist

I maybe insane, but that's optimism anyway.
