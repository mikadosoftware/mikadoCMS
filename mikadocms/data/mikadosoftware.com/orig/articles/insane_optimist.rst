The insane optimist
===================

I generally prefer to comment on longer term political trends - but Donald Trumps election today
is, as the whole campaign has been, an exception.

There is of course an element of post-hoc rationalisation as we come to accept that The Donald will be The Prez.  Which is why as a life-long optimist, I suspect I am being only slightly insane in saying "this might just work."

Firstly Donald is, in his bones and his building methods, a "borrow and spend" guy. And with both chambers now Republican, with an electorate that voted on jobs, with Trumps acceptance speech itself talking of building infrastructure and creating millions of jobs doing so, it is a safe bet to say Keynesianism is back on Americas agenda.  Obama consistently had Jobs programs denied him by Congress, a trick they will find almost impossible to play with a white Republican. 

In the U.K. We have just started to suffer from Brexit, but the fiscal response is starting to turn to building our way out.  As ever, the US may be about to show the way.

But Trumps win is more than a economic condition - it is a cultural win, mixed up in ill-defined racism, distrust of federal government and a feeling of a 1% that is out of touch.  There are, just as in Brexit, genuine problems and failures that need fixing being mixed up in a heady brew of hatred and anger.

Disentangling the genuine issues of structural economic and cultural change, of jobs lost and new people arriving, from the animal reaction to blame and lash out, is a difficult task that cannot be done from above, or by legal fiat.

This disentanglement is a local issue - each region has its own mix of this brew and must make its own solutions. A single fix from a federal capital can never help, but local solutions need support and the scaffolding from above to grow.

In recent years the US solved regional fiscal imbalances by simply having populations move, the young and talented congregating in the large population centres. Greece and the Euro has shown how a fiscal fix to a single currency problem can go badly wrong.  Fixing this without internal migration Europes only choice - and should be the first choice in the US. So we look to the States

The States of the US are flexing their independence and muscle more and more - from marijuana to solar power and gay marriage, the culture of the US is changing - as any living thing should - and changing from the ground up.  Europe is currently only seeing the federalist side of a Union - and we are hating it as much as most Americans I know hate their federal government, even as they acknowledge the benefits.

The UK has turned its back on this approach for now, but the calls for local and regional government are strong here - we can find ways to empower local government to solve local problems whilst avoiding the traps of single currencies and fluffing fiscal fixes.  

You see, Harmonisation is a virtuous word for an optimist.  Globalisation is a beneficial path for all.  Like your iPhone? One global standard.  Global standards have catapulted the internet into the forefront of tools to help humanity. At some point soon almost every adult on the planet will have a internet enabled phone. Able to communicate seamlessly with any other person on the planet.

Our politics is not keeping up with our economics - in international tax arbitrage, in control over company actions and culture we are seeing people feeling unable to have an effect - and this drives the backlash.  But with more local politics, and with a solution to Brexit that allows small nation sovereignty and still global harmonisation we may yet see a benefit.

And my last reason for being optimistic is a simple one. While the election ate up our column inches, John Kerry negotiated and signed a new climate change treaty with barely any fanfare.  While the clowns make a lot of noise, the rest of the circus can move the scenery around.  Diplomacy might just be able to take more chances not less.

The Donald's personal traits, his possible criminal sexual activity, do not give optimists much room for joy.  But beyond that, I think we should stop looking for a hero in our leaders. Stop looking for a perfect person to fix it, and start the process of building real local politics that still has a global reach, building bridges out to people near u but not like us, and also building actual bridges we can grow a stronger global community.

I maybe insane, but perhaps that's the price of optimism anyway.

Edit: no, I have changed my mind.  His deplorable personal characteristics seem now to be outweighed by his worse politics of discrimination and division. His apparent appointments are deeply worrying.  Perhaps we can hope that just as Obama had enormous trouble implementing his policies in face of Congress, so will Trump.  The United States is a large oil tanker that will turn slowly.  Insane optimism as I said.
