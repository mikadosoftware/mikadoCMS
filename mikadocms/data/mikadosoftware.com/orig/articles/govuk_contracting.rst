Contracting with the U.K. government.
-------------------------------------

Government contracts.  Government Software Contracts. The phrase conjures up images of bribery, corruption, fat profits for next no work. I am of course hoping this is all true once I find the secret handshake, but for the moment if you talk about software in government, you have to talk about GDS.

The Dream
---------

GDS brief history - minister, "user need", story of the software preference. Etc.

The idea of a *preference* for OSS is a game changer. It does not solve everything (what it does not solve is the heart of these posts) but it dramatically levels the playing field.  And that take me to my dream.

I of course have a dream.  Some years ago I was working for Rice University building an Open Source Education service and loving it, when the GDS started saying interesting things. And I realised I had a dream.  I wanted to spend a decade building high quality software that made actual digital services 

You see while we all moan and gripe and make fun of bureaucracy, the vast majority of government services are pointing in the right direction.  They make lives better for most people, protect those who are most vulnerable and essentially pick up the pieces.  It does not always work right, is frequently over subscribed but in the end most public servants take pride in doing the right thing and going in the right direction.

If you look at ldsl list, you can see over 2000 statutory services - the vast majority of which either have to be digital, or are going to benefit greatly from going digital.

And if you are a developer you know that why should our tax dollars or pounds go on proprietary licenses for things where there is basically no private market ('cos the demand for software to help Returning Officers to organise Polling booths is sky high amoungst international banks and hedge funds)

I rant on about this in the OSS4Gov manifesto - I reproduce it here.

So yes, OSS4gov.  I got a bit carried away. "Look the GDS says OSS. That must mean that every government depart now wants good OSS developers to build everything.  I will head off to the nearest government conference and tell them all the good news.  So I started a campaign website, headed off to LGSA and glad handed anyone who would listen, paid for a big breakfast bash (visitors - none) and ... Nothing happened.

Was I dejected? Was I down heartend? Yes actually.  And well out of pocket for sponsoring a lame breakfast.

But the dream is stil there 

The mission is a 19 year old with a rifle. Everything else is support.

The mission is a nurse with a bedpan 
Everything else is DevOps


I want to spend the next decade building open source software that makes people's lives better, doing it slowly, correctly, and spreading it out over countries that really could do with good digital government services but have no hope of affording it.  I mean once California pays for a social worker case management system, what is needed is good devs in each country to manage the localisation and ... Everyone wins.

So, how hard can it be to get one of these open source contracts.  I mean I am a fucking professional so doing the work is not a problem.

Turns out pretty darn difficult.

The risk profile
----------------

Getting government contracts is hard. Getting government contracts for something you promise to build then but does not exist yet is ... Well crazy hard.

Where to get government work: see YouTube 
Contracts finder: analysis
Roughly speaking there are two kinds of comtract: bums on seats and OneOfThosePlease

Bums on seats -
One of those please - 

Neither of these are 

So DOS -
