Services
========

Describing what I do as a software engineer is like a writer talking about
HB pencils and punctuation.  It's correct, but hardly useful to anyone not in
the profession.

So, I try and sell services instead.  Things that make other people money, *through the act of me writing and running new software*.  I just leave out the HB pencil bit.

At the moment I am focusing on two sectors - Digital agencies and ERP for SMEs.

OK, that's a little bit HB pencil isn't it?

For Digital Agencies I write *white label* software that helps their customers 
run SEO / CRO campaigns just a bit more configurable and useful than other tools on the market.

For SMEs, well, the future is coming - just as marketing departments have been
turned upside down by the web reaching in and pulling (see, SEO above), all 
the other business processes, invoicing, purchasing, HR are also going to 
get turned upside down and inside out.  

Which is where ERP comes in.  These processes are pretty simple - but web-enabling them is not.  Its going to be easier to replace them wholesale.  That's where I come in.

Call me.
