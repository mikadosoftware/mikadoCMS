The New Business Order
======================

Technical Marketing is an interesting new idea. (By new, sort of 1994).
Yahoo started indexing the web, and became *the* jumping off point for
almost all the world's web browsing.  It was a hybrid - lots of automation
to gather the exploding number of pages and try to categorise them, and 
lots of manual categorising as well.  Google has supplanted Yahoo, by automating
far far more, but they both try the same thing - to gather what everyone else
thinks is the best page for your query.

And this is an inversion - previous to 1994, searching the world for the most
appropriate of anything was a economic infeasibility.  Now it is pretty likely
to work, and for the best *information* on a subject it is almost guranateed.

The inversion is amazing - previously there were so many channels to reach 
a single customer, the message had to be broadcast, and loud, to get through.
Like a heart pumping blood.  But now.


The inversion will not stop at marketing.  The rest of a businesses actions,
its internal processes will be inverted too.  People will want the ability 
to discover the exact processes used, and the impact they will have and 
ability to choose between them (for convenience).  And it will happen.



In the future
=============

So, my first principle is to run to where the ball *will be*.  

Trying to predict the future is not a job solely for charlatans and fools.
Well, it is is you are after *specifics*, but if you are simply looking to see
tidal forces in the world and then position yourself to recieve the benefit of
the changing tides, it is generally doable.

*especially* if you know a little about technology, and have a healthy dose of
cynicism.  Luckily that I fit the bill there :-)

So, there is plenty more on my future section of the site, but for now lets take
a couple of ideas as given

* Most management will be automated, so a company can be run with fewer
people, further apart.

* Most marketing will be automated, and customers will find the best fit
for their needs online, and through networks

* Office jobs will be done remotely, mostly removing the commute and
changing the spaces we live in.

Mikadosoftware is dedicated to the future of work - I want to both build the
products and services I think will be used in the future, and live
and work according to the changes we shall all soon see.

You see I recently holiday'ed on the island of Kefalonia.  It is lovely, and
as I worked for a company 5,000 miles from my house in Kent, I saw no problem 
working an extra 1,000 miles away in Greece.  And really there is not much of a problem.  


Automated Marketing
-------------------

This is technical marketing, which lots of people write about. 

My approach to content marketing - I start an idea in my blog, then I might
write an article, and if I get really serious start a book.  Of which I have I
think three unfinished.

I shall expand here later.

Automated Management
--------------------

To my mind management consists of three functions - Modelling, Measureing and
Mentoring.

Modelling is like the Lean startups, finding a viable model of the world that
brings in profits.  It might be as simple as "buy low, sell high", or complex
hedge fund models taking up a dozen sheets on Excel.  Whatever, a model needs to
be created.  And what better way to create a model than in code.

Measureing - capturing KPIs and passing them down, to see if model is working
right.

Mentoring - aha - the part that is hard to automate.  But not hard to devolve
into a peer-to-peer and more informal network arrangement.

Remote working
--------------

There are lots of tips and tricks here.  But in the end, I have been remote by
thousands of miles and remote by one flight of stairs, and talked to the people
a flight above far far less than those a days travel away.
