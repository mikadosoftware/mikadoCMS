==========================================================
So, what are these *business skills* I keep hearing about?
==========================================================

There are a number of business processes, apart from my core "things I actually
get paid to do", that I believe I need to ensure are run at a minimum of "not
wrong".


* ABC - Admin, Bookkeeping and Cashflow
  Oh boy! 'nuff said.

* Technical Marketing : PR 
  Traditional, getting the name out.

* Technical Marketing : Discoverability 
  SEO, CRO, etc.

* Technical Marketing : Content Production
  Writing, lots of writing.

* Technical Marketing : Email life cycle
  mailchimp basically.

* Actual networking
  LinkedIn, keeping in touch

* Seminars and workshops
  Running your own

* Technical Marketing : Own CMS
  Having a high degree of control and flexibility over the publications
  and the metrics I measure.  This may well be a severe case of NIH
  but I am reluctant to outsource if I do not understand.  

Technical Marketing- wsay what?
===============================

OK, the Internet and software are eating the world.  This means that 
much much more of traditional business processes are wide open to 
being turned on their head by the Internet and exploited with software.

Right now, traditational marketing is getting turned upside down.  No longer is
it a question of mass broadcasting a message (advertising) and putting your
product as close to as many people as possible (distribution).  Its more about
*discoverability* - tuning your online presence to be searchable for those
people looking for services like yours.

So the more content that is targetted relevant, google-friendly you can produce,
and the more you can tune your web site to meet your audiencnes needs and
expecatations the more you will capture and sell.

However this is really icing on a cake.  The real underlying businesses have not
yet had this mass impact.  But it is coming.  Just as the inversion principle
has hit marketing, it will hit management and business processes.

In five or ten years bloggers will be writing this sort of thing and thinkig it
is obvious: The more you can tune your internal business processes to meet your
audiences needs and expectations,

So the internal workflow will need to be accessible via Internet, secure,
flexible, scalable, web-based basically.  And changing almost constantly. And
profitable.  Small batches of "value add process" will be analysed as
profitable, packaged together, perhaps auctioned off in a market, and then sold
to the people who placed the order.  Maybe. How should I know - do I have a
crystal ball?

Will this mean the end of innovation, or the end of advertising.  No, of course
not.  But the changes will be deep, long and permament.  And we should get out
in front of them.

Anyway, technical marketing - using software to automate, and Internet to
enable, new lower cost, higher reach means of getting people to buy.

(And to come, technical business process revolution - using software to automate
and Internet connectivity to enable, lower cost, higher customised, JIT products
and services *for* people to buy)


Admin, Bookkeeping and Cashflow
-------------------------------

Just gotta do it.  Its not rocket science.


Technical Marketing : PR 
------------------------

This is non-technical for now - find blogs and magazines and local
newspapers, and provide both articles, background info and quotes as needed.

Technical Marketing : Discoverability 
-------------------------------------

Aha - SEO, CRO and friends.

Technical Marketing : Content Production
----------------------------------------

Every day I write 2,000 words - Agatha Christie.

Technical Marketing : Email life cycle
--------------------------------------

Getting people to sign up is half way home.

Actual networking
-----------------

Its not linkedIN - its email, phone calls and coffee.
Its about mailing previous collegues to say hello, with 
no ulterior motive.  I tend to get people I have not heard from in 
two or three years saying "hi how are you long time, BTW I am looking for work ..."

Don't make that the first mail in 24 months, make it the 24th.

Seminars and workshops
----------------------

I just host a lunchtime IT group in a local pub.  Its on meetup. Its slow.

Technical Marketing : Own CMS
-----------------------------

My own version of NIH.
