Business Plan for Mikado Software
=================================

:Jan 2013 - Dec 2013:

Introduction
============

Welcome to my business plan.  It probably does not look much like 
other business plans, I have had enough of spreadsheets.

Anyway, MikadoSoftware is my *forever company* - what I intend to be working on
and in till I retire, or die, aged 110, shot by two jealous husbands.

And at the moment it is mostly a vehicle for IR35 style contracting.  I have
been very lucky and am working for a not-for-profit producing Open Source
software in Texas (see `my campaign <http://www.oss4gov.org/about>`_), but there
are signs of real life too.  I am not too sure I will be posting full financial details (my wife might want a say in that) but I will be putting up pretty much everything else.  

Which probably leads to why would I do that. And there is no very good answer - partly I doubt that this is super-secret competitive information.  I think that is usually a cover story for a lack of belief in ones own competitiveness.  Secondly I think it might make a few people take an interest in `following my footsteps <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6031403>`_.  And lastly, because if I don't write it down and make it public, I will lose the file in 6 months and have no idea what I am doing.

Products and Services
=====================

I am traditionally a coder for hire. Well, I was, before I was a manager for
hire, which it turns out is a lot worse than being a coder for hire.  I think
that traditional management is about to face a serious disruptive time as the
Internet hits its stride, and anyway I much prefer making things than writing
status reports.

(This is not to say leadership, mentoring, business skills and decision making
are not useful, just they are not the sole domain of management)

So now I have three major products or productised services

* ODI-SCM (`www.odietamo.org.uk <http://www.odietamo.org.uk>`_

* Mikado Technical Marketing (`mikado <http://www.mikadosoftware.com>`_

* Good old contracting.


Alongside this I am running a campaign to `promote OSS in local government <http://www.oss4gov.org/manifesto>`_. Sign up.

Aims
====

* To develop services and products to achieve equal to a contractor wage.

Plan A
------

1. Sell technical marketing services to local agencies.  This is the Brennan
Dunn / Patrick MacKenzie school of thought, and I think it it in the right
direction.

2. Sell consultancy and services around the ODI-SCM project, especially now Mark
has hit the boundary for six converting to 11g. (Its a OSS solution that allows
enterprises to actually get source code out of their ETL tools. ETL seems to be 
stuck in 1980s in terms of software development processes)


Plan B
------

* Custom (Python) development, preferably leaving sufficient time to work on 
Plan A

Plan C
------

* Contract job in London

Plan D
------

* FT job in London




Culture and Brand
=================

This is a big one, that I cover in different posts.  Sufficient to say, that I
have a clear idea of what I think work should be and it is not commuting to an
office, it involves play, and invention, learning and hard work, long distance 
working relationships and networks coming together and moving apart.



Clients
=======

Over communicate.  Then tell them some more.


Marketing
=========

This is a big issue - there is a `new marketing world </newbusinessorder>`_
and its good to start there.
