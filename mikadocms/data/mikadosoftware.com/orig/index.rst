To write great software and still spend time with my family 
-----------------------------------------------------------

All I wanted, was to do great work, and still be able to have breakfast with my children.

Two years ago I was driving 100 miles a day around London's M25, living the
typical consultant life.  It was however no way to raise a family and a dumb way
to run a company. 

So, I made two promises - I will not go back to the M25.  And I will not make
anyone working for me sacrifice their family for a career.

Mikado Software is a serious software company, and it is also a trail
breaking scout for a new generation of companies. 

Soon millions of us will be working for truly global companies who will pull
in the very best talent from anywhere, while we still work only a few minutes walk
from our loved ones.

You see globalisation is not just companies seeking the cheapest workers -
people can also seek out the best companies globally.  The boot is now on the
other foot.

Mikado Software will help you put your business in the best shape for the new
global future - because we are already living there.  Come join us.

My name is Paul Brian, and I am an Open Source Developer, father, husband and
entrepreneur.
