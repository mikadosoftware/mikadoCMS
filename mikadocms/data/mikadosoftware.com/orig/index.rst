Mikado Software
===============

I began this company with a simple idea - to build a place where programmers can
develop themselves, and then develop good software that helps the world at large.

I am proud of what this simple idea has achieved.  We offer services in two major
industries and are growing consistently and strong.

Our focus on Open Source software is a indicator of our underlying philosophy - that
software is increasingly core to modern life, and as such needs to be of the highest
quality, transparently written and structured to benefit all members of our society.

We respect the ideals of public service and aim to reflect those in our code base
and our profession.

The Mikado Manifesto
====================

* To build a software company that is not critical of coders, that is supportive
  of developers and wants to *build quality code first*, foremost, because
  that's where the long-term value comes from.

* To build a company dedicated to delivering working code, from any set of
  locations around the country and globe.

* To contribute to Open Source, Open Data and Open Organisations - most
  especially in the public sector.

* Profitably....
