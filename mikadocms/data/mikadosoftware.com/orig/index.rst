The Journey of Mikado Software
==============================

The journey to freedom
----------------------

I have worked in the "Internet Industry" since 1995.  Yes I am that old.

And I have done most jobs, from CTO to contractor, Developer to DBA.  

I ran some of the UK's first ADSL trials back when 14.4 modem was a big deal,
and have written software for the FTSE100 and the footie club.  

Now I want to create a different kind of software company.  One where 
we believe in the benefits of technology, where we live and work 
in balance, where we respect each others talents and failings, and we 
focus on transparency, learning and dammit, making value *and* meaning, money
and change.

In short I could not found a perfect company to work in, so I decided to
start one.

And things turned a corner.  I was able to walk into
work, able to make breakfast for my kids, let my wife have a lie in and a cuppa.[#]_

It is not heaven, bills still need to be paid, lawns mown, the office is tiny.

But like nearly 3 out of 4 workers, my job does not need to involve me
travelling to the same office as everyone else.  Nearly 75% of us could do the
same job from *anywhere*.  And we could do it minutes from our families, our
lives.


The journey for freedom
-----------------------

One of the defining characteristics of the next decade of the Internet is the
vast, vast amount of data that will be available, and the new insights that data
will afford us.  But it is too much data for any one company to own it and use
it.  All the pharamceutical companies will need to share their results to find
the next break throughs, all the financial companies will need to share their
trades to avoid the next crash.

Data will have to be *open* to be *big* and with that will come the open
software to handle the data, and the open forms of working (like above) that
will be used to write the software.

And this is my second journey - I am a `passionate believer
<http://www.oss4gov.org/manifesto>`_ in the role of open source in public sector
software.  Mikado Software is driven to put high quality, open software into
government and public sector hands.  We are not a lone voice, the new NHS Spine2
will be built on the open source Python language (a speciality of Mikado) and
the Government Digital Service is not just revamping websites, but pushing the
very definition of Open and Agile into the heart of UK government.

Journey's End
-------------

I care passionately about my family, which makes me not unique.  I also care
passionately that governments, councils and citizens all have the right to read
the software that more and more runs our lives.  The right to read it, critique
it, and one day remove the offending code.  Just as we do with our written laws
today.

Software matters now, and will matter more in the future.  It need to be kept
free and open so the laws that run our lives are as accessible as the laws that
govern us.

Mikado Software is the end of two journeys, a company that treats work that can
be done anywhere as an opportunity to work anywhere, and a company that creates
the future of public services.


The Mikado Manifesto
====================

* To build a software company that is not critical of coders, that is supportive
  of developers and wants to *build quality code first*, foremost, because
  that's where the long-term value comes from.

* To build a company dedicated to delivering working code, from any set of
  locations around the country and globe.  We do not have to travel 30 miles to
  just to sit at a desk all day.

* To contribute to Open Source, Open Data and Open Organisations - most
  especially in the public sector

* To do so profitably.
