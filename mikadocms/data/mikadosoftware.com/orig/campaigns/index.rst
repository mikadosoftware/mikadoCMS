Campaigns
=========

I am not averse to a little bit of politicking now and again.

In fact, its a necessary part of being in human society.  The pathological cases
we tend to see daily at our workplaces do tend to put us off, but I like to
think of politics as its original meaning - for the good of the body of the city 
(society these days).

So, I think there is a place and a case for standing up for something one
believes in and trying to openly, reasonably, persuade others of your case
