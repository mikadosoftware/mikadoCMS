The Council is seeking to increase the volume of ICT services it outsources to the SDP. The expected in-scope Service Components, out of scope Service Components and optional Service Components are detailed below.\nService Components In-scope\nIt is expected that all of the following areas will be delivered by the SDP directly.\nTransition to the new SDP\nThe SDP will manage and execute the transition of ICT services from the existing ICT suppliers and internal ICT Team to their solution. A 9-month transition window is planned. The SDP will also be responsible for the transfer of any relevant knowledge and resources.\nN.B. It is anticipated that a separate Data Centre and Disaster Recovery contract will be let before the SDP contract; and these services will be in place prior to the SDP contract commencement.\nThe Council will require a SDP who can rapidly mobilise to support this transition.\nService Provision\nThe SDP will be responsible for directly providing Service Delivery of the Council\u2019s IT services. The core ITIL v3.0 elements of Service Provision are:\n\u00b7Service Design: The Supplier will be expected to proactively manage the ICT Service provided to the Council. The Service will be structured in line with standard Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) v3.0 IT Service Categories and include proactive Service Management activities such as Capacity, Availability, Continuity, Security, Supplier Management, Service Level and Service Catalogue Management.\n\u00b7Service Transition: The supplier will be responsible for Application Maintenance and Development services. The Service will be structured in line with standard ITIL v3.0 IT Service Categories and will include: Change Management; Service, Asset and Configuration Management; and Release and Deployment Management.\n\u00b7Service Operation: The supplier will be expected to run the day-to-day operation of the service and the interface with the Council. The Service will be structured in line with standard ITIL v3.0 IT Service Categories and will include Request Fulfilment, Incident Management, Event Management and Access Management.\n\u00b7Continual Service Improvement: The Supplier will be expected to enhance the service throughout the life of the contract. The Service will be structured in line with standard ITIL v3.0 IT Service Categories and will include Service Reporting, Return on Investment (ROI), Service Measurement and Service Improvement Plus.\nService Towers\nThe SDP will be responsible for the Service Towers.\u00a0 The Service Towers include end user devices (e.g. Desktop, laptop, tablet, etc.), Local Area Network, Unified Communications, Security Infrastructure, ICT Infrastructure, Infrastructure Applications, Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) applications, and Line of Business applications.\nThe Council anticipates a number of specific Service Towers, identified below, being provided through a supply chain in order to meet specialist delivery requirements and encourage innovation, as well as enabling flexibility in contracting for commoditised hardware and services. These Service Towers are:\n\u00b7 Managed Print;\n\u00b7 Mobile Communications;\n\u00b7 IT Hardware and Software procurement;\n\u00b7 External Network Services, and\n\u00b7 Contact Centre Technology.\nThe Council anticipates that the SDP will create its own supply chain for the delivery of these towers.\nProfessional Services\nThe Council currently expects that these will be procured through an existing Council framework, however the Council reserves the right to access these services from the SDP where that makes business sense. These services could include but not be limited to: Business and Technology transformation; programme and project management, and significant change management and business analysis.\nService Components Out of Scope\nThere are two areas which are outside of the scope of the contract for the SDP and will be procured separately and directly by the Council:\n\u00b7 Data Centre and Disaster Recovery:This is expected to be the subject of a single restricted procurement. Any resulting contract will contain break points that are explicitly out of alignment with the Prime agent Contract to mitigate future transition risk. However, the resulting contract will be managed by the SDP;\n\u00b7 Web Design and Hosting:This is expected to be the subject of a separate framework agreement to allow the engagement of multiple suppliers supporting access innovative solutions and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME\u2019s) in the market place. The resulting contract will be directly managed by the Council.\nOptional Service Components\nThe following Service Components may be included within this procurement at the option of the Council for the purposes of ensuring suitable provision for contingencies and flexibility. These include:\n1. In -house ICT service delivery:This includes elements of the retained function including: Application Support and Training; Systems Development; ICT support to Schools currently delivered via CrEdIT; and Services currently provided by CALAT to Adult Education.\n2. Finance, HR and Payroll:Whilst the Council is currently pursuing provision of these services through other routes, it may choose to bring them in scope at some future date or to procure them independently.\n3. Revenue & Benefits Hosting and Printing specialist:Whilst the Council is currently pursuing provision of these services through other routes, they may choose to include them within the scope of this contract at some future date or to procure them independently.\n4. LBC Library service ICT:Whilst the Council is currently pursuing provision of these services through other routes, they may choose to include them within the scope of this contract at some future date or to procure them independently.Total quantity or scopeThe contract is expected to be for an eight (8) year period with an option (on the part of the contracting authority) to terminate the contract for convenience with effect from the end of years five (5) and seven (7). Additionally there will be an option on the part of the contracting authority to extend the contract by a further period of one (1) year with effect from the end of the eight (8) year initial contract period.Estimated Value: The expected aggregate value of this contract for provision of services to the Council is \u00a3250m (based on an eight (8) year projected contract term).\n\n  OJEU Reference Number: 234153-2012",

The strategy focuses on making things simpler, easier and more straightforward, for example by increasing self-service through electronic tools.\u00a0 \nThe council recognises that it has a very diverse customer base and therefore expecting all customers to access all services online through a website is inappropriate and unrealistic.\nThe council therefore wants to test take up of additional electronic means of reporting issues and requesting services, through digital TV, and through mobile phone based applications.\nThe council therefore wishes to appoint an established software supplier for a pilot period of two years to demonstrate and evaluate the potential of delivering services through these routes.\nThe reason behind a 2 year pilot is to fully test the customer acceptance and savings potential of a tool that supports digital self service across several platforms.\u00a0 This will include a full exploration of the integration potential of the tool with existing and expected technical architecture.\nSpecification \nThe Council is seeking a company to provide software tools to allow it to communicate with citizens. The software tool is required to do the following: \n\n Provision of a digital TV platform to provide browsable council information and allow reporting/requesting of services \n Provision of a smartphone app (to include iOS and Android) to provide browsable council information and allow reporting/requesting of services \n Both platforms should be able to be managed by a single content management system which allows variation of content by channel & service \n Both platforms should support citizen self-service and include services such as but not limited to\u00a0 \n \n Highways Faults \n Applying for Free School Meals \n Applying for Home to School Transport \n Self-Management of Social Care needs \n  \n The solution should provide APIs to allow it to integrate with MS Dynamics CRM \n The appointed supplier will work with the council to ensure that notifications received through these tools can be tailored to our business requirements \n A management information function allowing design of reports to include but not limited to numbers of downloads of App, Total number of reports/requests received, number of reports/requests abandoned, reports/requests abandoned point of abandon\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nExpected outputs\n\n A KCC Digital TV platform to enable citizens to browse information and report a number of issues/request services \n A KCC Smartphone App to browse information and report a number of issues/request services \n\nTimescales\nThe Council requires the work to be carried out from April 2013. This initial pilot is for two years and a separate market engagement and procurement exercise will be carried out after December 2014 for April 2015 onwards.\u00a0 \n\u00a0Assessment Methodology\nTenderers will be required to provide or demonstrate the following; \n\n Provide case study evidence and references of where the company has already provided a similar service to other Local Government authorities including identified savings and timescales for achieving those savings \n Provide an implementation plan outlining how the work will be approached; including any resources they will be using and proposed timescales \n Detailed Description of how the proposed solution meets the councils needs and can support a channel shift programme \n Provide evidence, including Curriculum Vitae, of the experience of the staff who will be carrying out the work \n Set out what resourcing/participation they will require from the Council to undertake the work set out in the specification and proposed timescales \n\nInterview\nTenderers may be asked to attend an interview to discuss their bid and answer any additional questions the council may have in relation to the bid. \nThe Purpose of this Notice\nWe are conducting a consultation exercise to give organisations who\u00a0might want to tender, the opportunity of commenting on the draft specification.\u00a0 The outcome of the market engagement will help determine how the council structures its tender opportunity in order to maximise effectiveness and value for money.\nTo this end, all suppliers that express an interest will be invited to comment.\u00a0 This is a two week consultation exercise and comments must be submitted by\u00a0noon on Friday 29th MARCH 2013.",
