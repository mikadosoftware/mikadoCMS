Open Source services
====================

Mikado lives and breathes Open Source Development. We maintain several well-received projects
and contribute to the F/OSS movement thorugh code, documentation, financial support and conferences.

The entry of F/OSS into especially GovTech is a long overdue recognition of the value this style of development can bring.
