<p>I am not averse to a little bit of politicking now and again.</p>
<p>In fact, its a necessary part of being in human society.  The pathological
cases we tend to see daily at our workplaces do tend to put us off, but
I like to think of politics as its original meaning - for the good of the body of the city (society these days).</p>
<p>So, I think there is a place and a case for standing up for something one believes in and trying to openly, reasonably, persuade others of your case</p>

<h2>Open Source Software at local government</h2>
<p>This is actually turning into a hefty piece for me - and you can read more about it <a class="reference external" href="/campaigns/OSSLG">here</a></p>
<p>In short, the UK government has a new &quot;CTO&quot; (Liam Maxwell) and he has published
the UK service design manual, which says OSS is &quot;preferred&quot; for government contracts.</p>
<p>Now I have always had one eye open on government software development, and everytime I go near I bounce away, realising one immutable fact</p>
<p>No matter how much I try, I need an <em>existing product</em> to demo and persuade and
pass the gatekeepers.</p>
<p>And if the problem domain is local government, <em>no-one who can code has ever had the itch</em> so there are <em>no useful OSS products</em> so no OSS software can get picked up by a local government.</p>

<h3>4x4 Open campaign</h3>
<p>So my new campaign is to</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Start four pilot projects with four local governments (councils etc)
such that each project focuses on a problem domain unique to
governments and then each council puts aside 1/4 of its expected budget
and instead pays good OSS developers to build, launch and support an
MVP.
</pre>
<p>I think there is only one way to break the catch-22 situation - and that is
to dance in front of the policy making higher ups and say &quot;less cost, better quality, whats there to lose?&quot;</p>
<p>My adventures will continue here.</p>
