My own manifesto
---------------------

.. The original of this was published around may 2015. Got will handle further fate chafes 

Usually UK election time is where I try and determine which candidate to vote for based on three newspaper headlines and a soundbite I took out of context. Even when I was younger and more politically active and engaged I have to say I never read a whole manifesto - maybe a digested version in a newspaper (back when there were newspapers on real paper!)

But as I have gotten older and wiser, I have come to realise that just cherry-picking what parties say on one subject and using that as a guide is frankly as lazy as simply not turning up to vote at all.

To be informed, I think I need not just to have opinions on keeping the NHS free, but to understand some of the trade offs across the whole national budget that such opinions cost.

In addition I have come to realise that there are very few dividing issues between the major parties - and that means one of two things : we have solved all the major problems of humankind and need just to do a bit of mopping up round the edges, or, and guess which is most likely, or we are flat out ignoring the big issues in our national political discourse.

When the two main parties are both saying they will both increase health spending, but accusing each other of national betrayals because they have different definitions of "increase in real terms" we can safely say the true arguments lie somewhere else.

I realised that the UK election is showing that no party seems to actually represent my (seemingly reasonable) views across all issues. A pick and mix approach to policies is sadly it seems, not allowed with just one cross to make, so I decided I should try and make a sensible, back-of-the-envelope-costed, attempt at balancing the policies I see before me.

Guiding philosophy:

I will campaign (to cheering crowds, 'natch) on three basic principles:

- "What works, works...". Our society is based on the amazing advances of science over the past few hundred years, from harnessing steam and electricity to advances in medicine. And all of these derive from a simple formula - take an idea, and test it against the real world. Keep the ideas that work.

Among doctors it is called "evidence-based medicine" - and it works incredibly well. So why should we not have "evidence-based politics". Is it better to teach children to read with phonetics or not? I don't know. But if we taught 5000 kids one way and 5000 another we could find out in one or two years and then just get on with it.

These are questions that should be answered not by loud debates, but by quiet experiment.

- secondly I shall be more radical. The difference in the spending plans between the major parties is *tiny*. The UK government spends about 750bn a year, out of a total GDP of 1.5trillion. And yet people are asking to be elected because the other guy or girl is going to cut a billion here or there. That's not even a percentage point. There is a big case for small changes, but if we are not talking about radical change on the order of 10% a time, we probably should not bother changing anything.
In other words - what is government for if its just the same as last time?

And thirdly "embrace the change, it's coming anyway". Our society is changing dramatically - and we need to learn to deal with it. I wrote this on an iPhone for example. I find it Hard to imagine my daily life without something that simply did not exist five years ago. And if the world is going to change, with or without us, then we may as well grasp it and make it the best change possible - not just hope it will turn out well.

Oh, and one last one. I am fed up to the back teeth hearing conflicting facts and figures. I can handle conflicting *explanations* for the same figures, but having politicians claim one set of figures (if you start counting from this year) and another set of figures (if you start counting from a different year!) is just debasing the whole value of science and measurement (which might be the point I guess).

So I will use (well try to) figures based on ONS statistics and will keep to a fixed set of base years. And, importantly, I will make it law that any political party or interest group, that publishes figures must also include the relevant closest figures from ONS. In short, everyone should be able to hear a common comparison of the problem.

In short, this manifesto is a focus on fairness of the tax base, and a focus on radical changes to adapt government to the radical changes of the world around us.

So onto the policies

Economy and Tax
----------

Britain creates about 1.5 trillion pounds worth of "value" every year. That is the price of goods sold abroad, the cost of haircuts cut in UK salons. Everything. And of that *about* half is collected in tax and then spent the way the government thinks best.

So the government spent around 732 billion in 2013/14 and will likely do the same in 2014/15.

The biggest parts of the pie are Welfare (including pensions) at 222bn, Health at 140bn, education at 98bn and debt payment at 53 bn. Now that adds up to a whopping 513bn or 70% of the 732bn spent.

Now even with my bad budgeting habits, it is going to be pretty dumb to just ignore 7/10ths of your spending - yet that's what most of the manifestos seem to be doing. It's like planning on losing weight by carefully measuring out your cornflakes and milk, and ignoring the chocolate cake you are going to have for dinner (and I speak from experience here :-)

So we *must* do what most politicians seem to be scared of - we must radically change how we run our biggest, most important institutions.

I am not saying get rid of, I am not saying massive cuts. I am especially not saying I will stand up and say we are "reorganising" the NHS and spend three years in a mad rush trying to boil the ocean, and find out we have no idea what worked or not.

No, let's be smart about this. We will use transparent, publicly monitored experiments that will tell us if the changes we want to make work and if they can scale up. If so, great, do more. If not fine, we have not spent three years and everyone's energy on a wasted idea.

So this will be one of my first laws - all public expenditure of over 10m ukp must include publicly available descriptions of the spending plan, plus success or failure criteria and public audits.

But back to the economy. And tax.

Companies pay 23% corporation tax, top whack. People pay 45% top whack and 40% is not uncommon. Why the big difference? Because people don't move countries or rearrange their income as easily as companies. We should refocus on less about employment and more about value and wealth created.

National insurance, income tax and even VAT vary based on employment rates - and the coming decades will see robots take a lot of jobs. But produce a lot more wealth for us humans.

But that means we need to switch our tax base from individuals income and spending and over to corporations, wealth and growth. We like growth, we like business, but we want them to pay a fair and clear proportion, because taxing the hell out of people because they cannot leave the country as easily as a business is not an acceptable strategy.

So I propose to slash income tax at the lower ends of the pay scale, and raise corporation tax and top rates of tax to compensate. (Figures to follow!)

Additionally I will add progressive wealth taxes - that is asset classes held will be subject to tax. This may be direct or indirect (ie taxing dividends).

Additionally I will introduce changes to encourage and ensure greater democratic accountability in corporations. Share ownership must be registered to an individual legal person. And that must be recorded on the company share register, and those shares so owned must votes in their wishes (goal to ensure active shareholding)

Additionally introduce bankruptcy legislation across all industries such that no company is too big to fail - and that necessary services such as utilities are not only well regulated but regularly stress tested against financial failure

Other tax issues - as part of a wealth tax review, we need a land value tax. So replace the council tax with a land value tax, and allow all cities of more than 100,000 residents to directly elect their own mayors, with powers to spend that land value tax. Regional groups will be used to pool and distribute the land value charges to balance rural and urban area differentials.

Additionally we should reduce capital gains on startups and shares acquired "under entrepreneurial conditions" - we want to encourge startups. Additionally we would reduce or defer capital gains on monies reinvested in new entrepreneur services.

A sliding scale of reduction on cgt would allow the cgt on the main creation of wealth (building the house, founding the company) to be significantly less taxes than the secondary capital gains from reselling a house or investing in the stock market. We see value in all these activities - but wish to encourage the earlier creation of new wealth. We shall boldly make these changes under published success and failure criteria, so the success of the changes to tax system can be evaluated by all.

Immigration
-------
Really I have to have this segment here, but honestly, why? Britain has had a ridiculously positive relationship with immigration over the centuries, and complaining that they are coming over here to take our jobs is missing the point. The robots are taking your jobs, and it's the white collar jobs that are going next. Immigration from the future is what people today should really be worried about.

I would also suggest that immigration (as in "stealing our jobs") is a proxy for other changes happening in our country - the increasing return to capital and the stagnation of incomes, especially at the low end. The increasing shift towards a older and so more welfare dependant population, and the increasing polarisation of work and wealth in cities and the South East. All of these make life harder and less rewarding if you are in the wrong place or wrong age.

This is why a focus on fairness of the tax base, and a focus on (seemingly) radical changes to adapt government to the (genuinely) radical changes of the world around us is so important to me.

Health and care
-------

The NHS is a fantastic idea, I owe it and its staff my life. And I did not even think if I could afford my care at the point of delivery. It is something to wonder at and be proud of.

But there are problems - and not simple ones like "disinfect a room". Slowly, A&E is becoming the default method to get seen. Because waiting 4 hours in A&E is a lot faster than waiting two weeks to book a ten minute appointment with a GP, and people assume they will get treated at the same time as diagnosed.

Entry into the medical funnel is the first problem to solve and we must, like in the rest of the NHS be innovative in solving it. But we must not be rash and think we know all the answers ahead of time.

We shall launch experiments in three key areas: provision of wide scale basic chronic services, provision of diagnosis services, and provision of large scale minor medication (such as immunisation)

Firstly diagnosis. How we can ensure disease is identified at the earliest opportunity is probably the most important single item in increasing positive outcomes for major diseases like cancer and heart disease.

Innovative methods to get people in for scans, innovative diagnosis methods and innovative means to present you and your GP with the best information as quickly as possible are to be trailed and judged. Ideas from around the world include yearly "MOTs" shall be trialed and costed.

Secondly handling the most costly patients. The elderly and chronically ill are the most costly to treat. This is quite normal and expected. But the way we supply that treatment *outside of the controlled environment of hospitals* is disjointed and inefficient. Every patient determined to be in that top 1% most expensive / chronic category will be assigned a care worker, who will work with them one on one to navigate the system, ensure right medications are taken correctly and generally ensure care is delivered. This approach has already shown great promise in the USA and (subject to properly controlled trials of course) should see us free up much needed staff and resources without the effort delay and cost of just building more.

A greater focus on care in the home and out of hospital is needed. The vast majority of care, even when the patient needs the world class facilities large hospitals can provide, the vast majority of care for chronic patients is still day to day consistency and application.

We have world class medical facilities, some of the planets leading medical staff, but it is foolish to then hope that patients return home and perfectly self administer what can be a dizzying array of medications and requirements. We can support our best medical staff by ensuring their efforts are backed up by simple, one on one *care*.

We shall know of this is working or not because our goal in ten years is to double the average GP appointment time from ten minutes to twenty minutes.

Lastly we want to look at the success of asthma clinics. Over past few years enormous effort has been made to get chronic patients (like myself) in for assessment and treatment. It has not only improved care but the simple processes GPs set up to get it working (ie one dedicated asthma nurse) were vastly more "productive". And we think there is much of the GPs front facing services that can benefit from such specialisation. I mean we don expect one factory to make our cars, our clothes and our phones, so why expect our GPs to be perfect generalists.

Welfare and pensions
------

As a nation we are living longer. That's a good thing, obviously. What is less good is that the way we fund pensions is to tax the people who are working and then give the money to the retired and the unemployed. Roughly we spend 222bn a year on "welfare", but how that breaks down is interesting - spending on elderly care (excluding health) is about 19% of our 732bn and 14% is on those of working age (which includes benefits for children, disability etc). Sadly there is no "scroungers" category.

The maths is simple. There are going to be more retired (ie old) people in the UK than working (ie young). And currently pensions work by taxing the working and giving to the retired.

We shall introduce mandatory pension contributions for all workers, increase the retirement age to 68 for both men and women.

This is partly why a wealth tax is needed - there will simply be less young people in the country and so less people working to tax. We could all of course decide to have lots more kids - I suppose the campaign posters for "just say yes to sex" would be interesting, but the long term trend seems inevitable.

Law and order
-------

Police officers these days spend a notable amount of time acting in concert with other parts of the "social protection services" - Heath and social services. This is we assume because people committing crimes are likely to come from "broken" social backgrounds as well.

We want to see more targeted assistance to these highest demand people. Just as 1% of patients soak up way more health resources, a small number of criminals soak up more police time than needed. The more we can take this burden off the more we free up police.

Additionally new technology is making huge changes in how police can identify suspicious behaviour and monitor people. We shall introduce a referendum seeking a mandate for balancing any right to privacy with the ability for mass surveillance to help in crime and national security.

Additionally we shall introduce legislation on producing legal definitions and limits for National Security, so that when the security of the nation is invoked it is clear what level of threat is being considered.

Education
------

Double the science budget, improve funding for STEM education and stop our highly trained scientists leaving science or leaving the country.

Housing
------
Land value tax has been discussed elsewhere. We would like to encourage increased supply of desperately needed new homes - and will introduce new experiments to that end, ranging from a land value tax and CGT changes, new energy standards for houses and new construction methods.

Europe, Foreign and defence
--------
I am British. I am proud to be British. But it seems I am proud for very different reasons that many other people who write manifestos saying they are proud to be British.

I am proud to be British when our department of international aid does actually spend the UN recommendation of 0.7% of our national income on helping the poorest of the planet. I am proud to be British when a government department (yes the civil service) can arrange a plane of medical and disaster supplies to land in Nepal barely a day and a half after one of this centuries biggest Earthquakes killed thousands there.

I am proud to be able to say that we are one of the richest nations on earth and we care. It is enough? Of course not. We could give away everything and still not solve the worlds problems on our own. But I refuse to believe that cutting money and aid from the very poorest on the planet and dropping it instead into vast building projects in the UK is the best use of 0.7% of my tax.

One thing I do say is that programs the DFI invest in must be audited and evaluated to show worthwhile returns. I think we should take the same methodologies and use them to study any expenditure greater than 50million in this country.

Europe
--------

We need to keep a long term view on our world and our decisions. Countries are like the proverbial oil tankers - once you get them moving they take a long time to turn or adjust course.

Over the decades to come only big major trends can be discerned - things like

we will see more elderly people, less young people in well off countries leading to a tax base unable to pay for its welfare and pensions unless we change how we tax and how we supply the social support.

We will see rise in technology and robotics replacing white collar jobs as it has done to blue collar jobs in past, leading to dislocation effects in the hanging world of work.

We will see rise of new economic powers, such as the Indian sub-continent. and probably China and Brazil.

If the UK wishes to manage to capture a share of global economic growth greater than its share of population it will need to be able to compete with these new economic superpowers

What gives America its economic edge? We can make five fairly controversial statements about American economic advantage but they are worth considering.

- massive immigration flows, and unusual racial culture keeping bottom ten per cent of labour cost at fixed levels by ensuring that the labour force has lots of competition

- military superiority buying political and economic favouritism. This is the most controversial, and hardest to quantify.

- resilient democratic system able to correct for incompetence and corruption in administration

- broad internal economic base able to withstand sector shocks, supply an internal market and a federal system able to compensate for geographic imbalances

- tendency for government to effectively and well seed technological investment

There are many lessons to learn, and it is worth asking which of these we can emulate

1. Democratic resilience. Yes, and the existence of a written constitution is key
2. Government seed investment - this is a policy issue tied to our science and education aims
3. And the rest, military success, ability to move resources from different areas of a continent and the immigration of new blood - these are not things a small island race can conjure up. But as part of a larger, federal Europe we can.

We shall then seek a referendum on further integration in Europe - either a full federal centralised banking system or a Breton woods style "Europe Bnak"

Defence.
----------
We cannot afford an expensive armed forces and we cannot afford to sit at home. We must get smarter about our defence.

We cannot afford to play the aircraft carrier game either - ships are basically targets for missiles and missiles get cheaper and faster.
We are in a world where a warship takes a decade to build and lasts four decades - and in far far less than that hobbyist drones will be able to be manufactured in sufficent quantity and carry sufficent explosive as to make make admirals ships look like those guys who have bees swarm on their necks like beards.

Basically if it's not a submarine, it's a target. If it is a submarine it's only use is launching nuclear missiles (drones can do the other submariner job). And frankly how often do I want to wipe out all life in Russia?

I think we scale back the "strategic" nuclear defence to a much much more credible tactical nuclear defence, and invest the savings in infantry training and support. We still want boots on the ground, sadly.

Environment
-------
Follow the stern recommendations
Invest in green energy
Set target of 25% energy from coal and oil by 2035
Make home energy efficiency a priority - every new home should be passively heatable from a 1KW fire.

Seriously it's the end of the planet if we don't fix it. A rise in ocean levels of 6metres! Let's not take that chance.

Transport
------
Commuter journeys - slash train subsidies, raise coach subsidies, push coach for electric and non oil based fuels

Local gov
-----
Locally elected mayors and regional assemblies to be encouraged.

Rural affairs
-------
Investment in farming new technology
Massive focus on reduction in meat - as part of contribution to global warming start taxing meat production - seriously guys, the end of the fucking planet , ok?

So that's my manifesto. I have not managed to research it as much as I want, and will keep chipping away as I go, but it has been interesting just addressing a broad set of questions and trying to see how they fit together. I look forward to working out how to cost this as we go.
