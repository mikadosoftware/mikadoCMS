Privacy is dead.  Wait till they notice the corpse

Privacy looks a lot like Secrecy
--------------------------------

One of my favourite political quotes was from one of my favourite politicians.
Ex-London Mayor "Red" Ken Livingstone is supposed to have said, when asked why
he had not told the press about his unusual private life [#]_ he said something
like "I kept it private, not secret. Just because I do not tell journalists,
does not mean I am hiding something"

This is an interesting division between two concepts that are rapidly diverging.

My privacy is what I do "behind closed doors".  However, anyone passing my house
can probably hear whats going on, and generally work out from clues left by my
daily life just what does go on behind those doors (err, not a lot sadly).

Now however, the digital footprint of my daily life can be heard and analysed not merely by my neighbours, but by anyone on the Internet who cares to listen.

This is generally seen as a problem.


It is. 


But its not going away.

   with several children seemingly well-adjusted.  Unusual not illegal or
   damaging. Also he got married in London Zoo which despite me begging my
   rather stunned fiance on a trip round the facilities, did not happen.  Truly,
   a cool place to marry.
