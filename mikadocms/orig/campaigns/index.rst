Campaigns
=========

I am not averse to a little bit of politicking now and again.

In fact, its a necessary part of being in human society.  The pathological 
cases we tend to see daily at our workplaces do tend to put us off, but 
I like to think of politics as its original meaning - for the good of the body of the city (society these days).

So, I think there is a place and a case for standing up for something one believes in and trying to openly, reasonably, persuade others of your case

Open Source Software at local government
----------------------------------------

This is actually turning into a hefty piece for me - and you can read more about it `here </cms/campaigns/OSSLG>`_

In short, the UK government has a new "CTO" (Liam Maxwell) and he has published 
the UK service design manual, which says OSS is "preferred" for government contracts.

Now I have always had one eye open on government software development, and everytime I go near I bounce away, realising one immutable fact

No matter how much I try, I need an *existing product* to demo and persuade and 
pass the gatekeepers.  

And if the problem domain is local government, *no-one who can code has ever had the itch* so there are *no useful OSS products* so no OSS software can get picked up by a local government.


4x4 Open campaign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So my new campaign is to ::

   Start four pilot projects with four local governments (councils etc)
   such that each project focuses on a problem domain unique to 
   governments and then each council puts aside 1/4 of its expected budget
   and instead pays good OSS developers to build, launch and support an
   MVP.

I think there is only one way to break the catch-22 situation - and that is 
to dance in front of the policy making higher ups and say "less cost, better quality, whats there to lose?"

My adventures will continue here.
