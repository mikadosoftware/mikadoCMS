Open Source Software at local government
----------------------------------------

There is a catch-22 at the heart of government adoption of Open Source Software.

I keep a weather-eye on published government software contracts, and they tend
to, even those that say "development", expected existing products. That is 
build something then sell it.  And you cannot get away with a mock up or an
MVP - these people carry out proper due diligence!

For most of the problems unique to (local) government, no-one will make 
decent Open Source solutions organically, simply because no-one with the skills
has the problem.

The venn diagram of people with good software skills, a propensity to release
open source and are currently stuck with an itch for really good Returning
Officer Software is ... well three seperate coloured circles.

And thats a problem.


4x4 Open campaign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So my new campaign is to ::

   Start four pilot projects with four local governments (councils etc)
   such that each project focuses on a problem domain unique to 
   governments and then each council puts aside 1/4 of its expected budget
   and instead pays good OSS developers to build, launch and support an
   MVP.

I think there is only one way to break the catch-22 situation - and that is to
dance in front of the policy making higher ups and say "less cost, better
quality, whats there to lose?"

   Just tell us what you need, and we will go build it

Seeding Open Source in Local Government
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I see this as planting seeds of open software in local government.  My
experience of OSS has been like Japanese knock-weed.  Let us get a foothold and
just stand back.

Also Japanese knock-weed is pretty tasty this time of year, fried with burdock
root if I `remember <http://fergustheforager.co.uk/>`_

Hmm, a little off-topic - I guess I am hungry.

Will it work ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am not au fait with the OSS landscape in government.  Its probably not pretty
and limited to the server room.  But I am pretty certain (all/most) of our
elected representatives are not fools and I am absolutely certain they need to
save cash.


The time is right
-----------------

It certainly seems that we have the right people in the right places.

`Liam Maxwell <http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/tag/liam-maxwell/>`_ is
making all the `right
<http://www.openforumeurope.org/openprocurement/open-procurement-library/Better%2520for%2520less.pdf>`_
`noises <https://www.gov.uk/service-manual>`_ and the `GOV.UK
<https://www.gov.uk/>`_ project is knocking the deliveries over the boundary
sights as far as I am concerned.

How this central government change translates into local work I do not know.  We
should not underestimate Sir Humphrey, however, I am forever optimistic.

Next steps
----------

I am organising a fringe meeting at the Local Government Association `Annual
Conference < http://sites.idea.gov.uk/annual-conference/>`_ - basically I want
to find my 4x4 councillors there. If I cannot get 4 leaders or Chief Execs out
of 500 expected to turn up to say "yes, I want to save money by more accurately
meeting my needs" I need to hang up the suit.

I am arm-twisting Maidstone's Chief Exec this month, and if you have contacts at
your council let me know.

Contact me if you want to help.  I could do with it.


This is actually turning into a hefty piece for me - and you can read more about it `here </cms/campaigns/OSSLG>`_
