Reviewing the Local Government OSS landscape
============================================

Taking action with data is usually pretty foolish.  So here I am trying to 
gather information on the state of OSS in government bodies, with a view to 
getting actionable information.  

Highlights
----------

There are four seperate areas of software systems governments can spend 
money on, when drawn on two dimensions look like this


 Degree to which 
 needs and requirements
 differ in public sector
   ^
   |config  Pure
   |
   |
   |
   |Office  Hybrid 
   ---------------> Degree to which the code / systems need to be different or just configured.





* Pure - unique to government
  An example of this type is "Electoral Roll Management systems", or "Burial Service Systems" (Put it this way, eventually that system needs to handle 100% of the customers!)

* hybrid - strongly biased towards common good / government, with 
  components that are reused from commercial world (game simulation software)
   "Fire Brigade Incident Training simulation software"
   "Housing Systems" (a pretty broad tent but ranging from tenant / maintenance to Housing benefit)


* unique configuration
  A common framework with commerical world, but uncommon needs.
  An example would be Customer Relationship Management.
  Often monitoring a citizen's reported debt levels

* commerical copies - a strong overlap with commerical organisation needs
  e.g. Office SPreadsheet software.
  Google docs, microsoft word, OpenOffice.  Take your pick, choose LaTeX.
