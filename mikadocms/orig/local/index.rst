Local Events
============

It is a simple, human need.  To meet, and socialise with other human beings.

So I try and run a local meetup group here in Kings Hill (Pilgrim's Silicon Way) - `sign up <http://www.meetup.com/Kings-Hill-Professional-IT-Meetup-with-a-dash-of-Geek-Nerd/>`_.

Next one is Weds 12th June.  Hurry!
