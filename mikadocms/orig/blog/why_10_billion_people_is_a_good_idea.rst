Apparently we are going to live on a planet with 10 Billion people on it by the
year 2050.  For population scientists and the like it is a done deal - today the children are born who will themselves grow up and have more children - the maths is simple and uncomplicated.  Only asteroids, nukes or a sudden refusal for teenagers to want sex, will stop it.  (And yes you can rank those in order of probability anyway you want:-)

Now, I would have thought it a good idea to have 10 billion people - more people, more production, more culture, more wealth more fun.

Some people think it is a disaster.  Some even say "certain" populations should be encouraged not to "reproduce".  (There is a lot underlying that) 
Well, I used to argue that we needed to trust we can find solutions, improve energy efficency that sort of thing.

But I think a better counter-argument is supplied by two teenage boys who both gave Ted Talks: Each one came from backgrounds that would qualify for "not reproducing" - and ... well just watch.  I can't be bothered to argue any more.
